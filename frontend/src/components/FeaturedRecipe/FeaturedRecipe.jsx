          <h3>Beef Stir-Fry</h3>
          <p>
            Beef stir-fry is a quick and flavourful dish made by saut√©ing thinly
            sliced beef with a mix of colourful vegetables like bell peppers,
            broccoli, and carrots. Cooked in a savoury sauce often made with soy
            sauce, garlic, ginger, and a hint of sesame oil, this dish delivers
            a perfect balance of tender meat and crisp vegetables. Served over
            rice or noodles, it's a satisfying and wholesome meal ideal for busy
            weeknights.
